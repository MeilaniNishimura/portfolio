                    <h1><u>My Story</u></h1>
                     <strong><small>A little bit about my background.</small></strong>
                     <p> My name is Meilani Nishimura. I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1998, the youngest of four girls. Unfortunately, I left Hawaii at a young age. I spent my childhood in Orlando, Florida, then moved to the great state of Texas. I went to high school in Alabama, and came back to Texas 6 years ago. </p>

                     <h1><u>Present Day</u></h1>
                     <strong><small>More about me now.</small></strong>
                     <p>I have most recently been working in the healthcare industry as a phlebotomist. I have always been interested in computer science and coding, but didn't know how to go about learning to code. When I discovered coding temple, I knew this would be a great place for me to begin. My partner and I are currently expecting our first child, and she has motivated me to finally enter the coding world.

                     </figure>
                     <p>I hope to build a solid foundation for a future career here at coding temple. My daughter is due to arrive four days after the end of the cohort, and I hope to make her proud!</p>

                     <strong><small>What I like to do in my freetime.</small></strong>
                     <p>I am an introvert and like to spend a lot of my time alone or with very specific people. Some of my favorite things to do include reading, hiking, and spending time with family.
                         My family and I enjoy making trips to the lake nearby, or grabbing fresas con crema from the Dallas bazaar. Although in the past I was never much of an animal lover, one of my all time favorite things to do is play with the two family dogs, Luna and Malia.
                         Luna enjoys swimming and long walks by the lake, while Malia enjoys barking at people and eating anything she can find.

                        <strong><small>Some things that I think are the best of the best.</small></strong>
                        <p>My favorite books of all time are the books in the Harry Potter series. I would say the first book (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) in particular is my all time favorite. Aside from that I usually find myself reading new books rather than picking up the same ones again and again. As for movies, my favorites are probably Pulp Fiction and Jennifer's Body. Those are movies that I have watched countless times.
                           I wouldn't say that I really have a faovorite song, but I really like the band 'The Killers' and I love any music from the 80's.
